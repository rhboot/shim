This file is the single source for SbatLevel revocations the format
follows the variable payload and should not have any leading or
trailing whitespace on the same line.

Short descriptions of the revocations as well as CVE assignments (when
available) should be provided when an entry is added.

On systems that run shim, shim will manage these revocations. Sytems
that never run shim, primarily Windows, but this applies to any OS
that supports UEFI Secure Boot under the UEFI CA without shim can
apply SBAT based revocations by setting the following variable
from code running in boot services context.

Attributes: (EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE | EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS)
