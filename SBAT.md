# UEFI shim bootloader secure boot life-cycle improvements
## Background
In the PC ecosystem, [UEFI Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) is typically configured to trust 2 authorities for signing UEFI boot code, the Microsoft UEFI Certificate Authority (CA) and Windows CA. When malicious or security compromised code is detected, 2 revocation mechanisms are provided by compatible UEFI implementations, signing certificate or image hash. The UEFI Specification does not provides any well tested additional revocation mechanisms.

Signing certificate revocation is not practical for the Windows and Microsoft UEFI CAs because it would revoke too many UEFI applications and drivers, especially for Option ROMs. This is true even for the UEFI CA leaf certificates as they generally sign 1 entire year of UEFI images. For this reason UEFI revocations have, until recently, been performed via image hash.

The UEFI shim bootloader provides a level of digital signature indirection, enabling more authorities to participate in UEFI Secure Boot. Shims' certificates typically sign targeted UEFI applications, enabling certificate-based revocation where it makes sense.
As part of the recent "BootHole" security incident [CVE-2020-10713](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10713), 3 certificates and 150 image hashes were added to the UEFI Secure Boot revocation database `dbx` on the popular x64 architecture. This single revocation event consumes 10kB of the 32kB, or roughly one third, of revocation storage typically available on UEFI platforms. Due to the way that UEFI merges revocation lists, this plus prior revocation events can result in a `dbx` that is almost 15kB in size, approaching 50% capacity.

The large size of the BootHole revocation event is due to the inefficiency of revocation by image hash when there is a security vulnerability in a popular component signed by many authorities, sometimes with many versions.

Coordinating the BootHole revocation has required numerous person months of planning, implementation, and testing multiplied by the number of authorities, deployments, & devices. It is not yet complete, and we anticipate many months of upgrades and testing with a long tail that may last years

Additionally, when bugs or features require updates to UEFI shim, the number of images signed are multiplied by the number of authorities.

## Summary
Given the tremendous cost and disruption of a revocation event like BootHole, and increased activity by security researchers in the UEFI Secure Boot space, we should take action to greatly improve this process. Updating revocation capabilities in the UEFI specification and system firmware implementations will take years to deploy into the ecosystem. As such, the focus of this document is on improvements that can be made to the UEFI shim, which are compatible with existing UEFI implementations. Shim can move faster than the UEFI system firmware ecosystem while providing large impact to the in-market UEFI Secure Boot ecosystem.

The background section identified 2 opportunities for improvement:

1. Improving the efficiency of revocation when a number of versions have a vulnerability

   * For example, a vulnerability spans some number of versions, it might be more efficient to be able to revoke by version, and simply modify the revocation entry to modify the version each time a vulnerability is detected.
2. Improving the efficiency of revocation when there are many shim variations

   * For example, a new shim is released to address bugs or adding features. In the current model, the number of images signed are multiplied by the number of authorities as they sign shims to gain the fixes and features.

Microsoft has brainstormed with partners possible solutions for evaluation and feedback:

1. To improve revocation when there are many versions of vulnerable boot images, shim, GRUB, or otherwise, investigate methods of revoking by image metadata that includes generation numbers. Once targeting data is established (e.g. Company foo, product bar, boot component zed), each revocation event ideally edits an existing entry, increasing the trusted minimum security generation.
2. To improve revocation when there is a shim vulnerability, and there are many shim images, standardize on a single image shared by authorities. Each release of bug fixes and features result in 1 shim being signed, compressing the number by dozens. This has the stellar additional benefit of reducing the number of shim reviews, which should result in much rejoicing. The certificates used by a vendor to sign individual boot components would be picked up from additional PE files that are signed either by a shim-specific key controlled by Microsoft, or controlled by a vendor, but used only to sign additional key files. This key built into shim is functionally similar so a CA certificate.
The certificates built into shim can be revoked by placing the image hash into dbx, similar to the many shim solution we have today.

## Proposals
This document focuses on the shim bootloader, not the UEFI specification or updates to UEFI firmware.

### Generation Number Based Revocation
Microsoft may refer to this as a form of UEFI Secure Boot Advanced Targeting
(SBAT), perhaps to be named EFI_CERT_SBAT. This introduces a mechanism to
require a specific level of resistance to UEFI Secure Boot bypasses.

#### Generation-Based Revocation Overview
Metadata that includes the vendor, product family, product, component, version and generation are added to artifacts. This metadata is protected by the digital signature. New image authorization data structures, akin to the EFI_CERT_foo EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA structure (see Signature Database in UEFI specification), describe how this metadata can be incorporated into allow or deny lists. In a simple implementation, 1 SBAT entry with security generations could be used for each revocable boot module, replacing many image hashes with 1 entry with security generations. To minimize the size of EFI_CERT_SBAT, the signature owner field might be omitted, and recommend that either metadata use shortened names, or perhaps the EFI_CERT_SBAT contains a hash of the non-generation metadata instead of the metadata itself.

Ideally, servicing of the image authorization databases would be updated to support replacement of individual EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA items. However, if we assume that new UEFI variable(s) are used, to be serviced by 1 entity per variable (no sharing), then the existing, in-market SetVariable(), without the APPEND attribute, could be used. Microsoft currently issues dbx updates exclusively with the APPEND attribute under the assumption that multiple entities might be servicing dbx. When a new revocation event takes place, rather than increasing the size of variables with image hashes, existing variables can simply be updated with new security generations, consuming no additional space. This constrains the number of entries to the number of unique boot components revoked, independent of generations revoked. The solution may support several major/minor versions, limiting revocation to build/security generations, perhaps via wildcards.

While previously the APPEND attribute guaranteed that it would not be possible to downgrade the set of revocations on a system using a previously signed variable update, this guarantee can also be accomplished by setting the EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS attribute. This will verify that the
timestamp value of the signed data is later than the current timestamp value associated with the data currently stored in that variable.

#### Generation-Based Revocation Scenarios

 Products (**not** vendors, a vendor can have multiple products or even
pass a product from one vendor to another over time) are assigned a
name. Product names can specify a specific version or refer to the
entire product family. For example mydistro and mydistro,12.

 Components that are used as a link in the UEFI Secure Boot chain of
trust are assigned names. Examples of components are shim, GRUB,
kernel, hypervisors, etc.

 We could conceivably support sub-components, but it's hard to
conceive of a scenario that would trigger a UEFI variable update that
wouldn't justify a hypervisor or kernel re-release to enforce that
sub-component level from there. Something like a "level 1.5 hypervisor" that
can exist between different kernel generations can be considered its own
component.

 Each component is assigned a minimum global generation number. Vendors
signing component binary artifacts with a specific global generation
number are required to include fixes for any public or pre-disclosed
issue required for that generation. Additionally, in the event that a
bypass only manifests in a specific product's component, vendors may
ask for a product-specific generation number to be published for one
of their product's components. This avoids triggering an industry wide
re-publishing of otherwise safe components.

 A product-specific minimum generation number only applies to the instance of
 that component that is signed with that product name. Another product's
 instance of the same component may be installed on the same system and would
 not be subject to the other product's product-specific minimum generation number.
 However, both of those components will need to meet the global minimum
 generation number for that component. A very likely scenario would be that a
 product is shipped with an incomplete fix required for a specific minimum
 generation number, but is labeled with that number. Rather than having the
 entire industry that uses that component re-release, just that product's
 minimum generation number would be incremented and that product's component
 re-released along with a UEFI variable update specifying that requirement.

 The global and product-specific generation number name spaces are not
tied to each other. The global number is managed externally, and the vast
majority of products will never publish a minimum product-specific generation
number for any of their components. Unspecified, more specific generation
numbers are treated as 0.

 A minimum feature set, for example enforced kernel lock down, may be
required as well to sign and label a component with a specific
generation number. As time goes on, it is likely that the minimum
feature set required for the currently valid generation number will
expand. (For example, hypervisors supporting UEFI Secure Boot guests may
at some point require memory encryption or similar protection
mechanism.)

The footprint of the UEFI variable payload will expand as product-specific
generation numbers ahead of the global number are added. However, it will
shrink again as the global number for that component is incremented again.  The
expectation is that a product-specific or vendor-specific generation number is
a rare event, and that the generation number for the upstream code base will
suffice in most cases.

A product-specific generation number is needed if a CVE is fixed in
code that **only** exists in a specific product's branch. This would either
be something like product-specific patches, or a mis-merge that only
occurred in that product. Setting a product-specific generation number
for such an event eliminates the need for other vendors to have to
re-release the binaries for their products with an incremented global
number.

However, once the global number is bumped for the next upstream CVE
fix there will be no further need to carry that product-specific
generation number. Satisfying the check of the global number will also
exclude any of the older product-specific binaries.

For example: There is a global CVE disclosure and all vendors coordinate to
release fixed components on the disclosure date.  This release bumps the global
generation number for GRUB to 4.

 SBAT revocation data would then require a GRUB with a global
 generation number of 4.

However, Vendor C mis-merges the patches into one of their products and
does not become aware of the fact that this mis-merge created an
additional vulnerability until after they have published a signed
binary in that, vulnerable, state.

 Vendor C's GRUB binary can now be used to compromise anyone's system.

To remedy this, Vendor C will release a fixed binary with the same
global generation number and the product-specific generation number
set to 1.

 SBAT revocation data would then require a GRUB with a global
 generation number of 4, as well as a product-specific generation
 number of 1 for the product that had the vulnerable binary.

If and when there is another upstream fix for a CVE that would bump
the global number, this product-specific number can be dropped from
the UEFI revocation variable.

If this same Vendor C has a similar event after the global number is
incremented, they would again set their product-specific or version-specific
number to 1. If they have a second event on with the same component, they would
set their product-specific or version-specific number to 2.

In such an event, a vendor would set the product-specific or version-specific
generation number based on whether the mis-merge occurred in all of their
branches or in just a subset of them. The goal is generally to limit end
customer impact with as few re-releases as possible, while not creating an
unnecessarily large UEFI revocation variable payload.

The product-specific generation number does not reset and continues to
monotonically increase over the course of these events.	Continuity of
more specific generation numbers must be maintained in this way	in
order to satisfy checks	against	older revocation data.

The variable payload will be stored publicly in the shim source base
and identify the global generation associated with a product or
version-specific one. The payload is also built into shim to
additionally limit exposure.


#### Retiring Signed Releases

Products that have reached the end of their support life by definition
no longer receive patches. They are also generally not examined for
CVEs. Allowing such unsupported products to continue to participate in
UEFI Secure Boot is at the very least questionable. If an EoSL product
is made up of commonly used components, such as the GRUB and the Linux
kernel, it is reasonable to assume that the global generation numbers
will eventually move forward and exclude those products from booting on
a UEFI Secure Boot enabled system. However a product made up of GRUB
and a closed source kernel is just as conceivable. In that case the
kernel version may never move forward once the product reaches its end
of support. Therefor it is recommended that the product-specific
generation number be incremented past the latest one shown in any
binary for that product, effectively disabling that product on UEFI
Secure Boot enabled systems.

A subset of this case would be a beta-release that may contain eventually
abandoned, experimental, kernel code. Such releases should have their
product-specific generation numbers incremented past the latest one
shown in any released, or unreleased, binary signed with a production
key.

Until a release is retired in this manner, vendors are responsible for
keeping up with fixes for CVEs and ensuring that any known signed
binaries containing known CVEs are denied from booting on UEFI Secure
Boot enabled systems via the most up to date UEFI metadata.

#### Vendor Key Files

Even prior to or without moving to one-shim, it is desirable to get
every vendor onto as few shims as possible. Ideally a vendor would
have a single shim signed with their certificate embedded and then use
that certificate to sign additional <Vendor>_key.EFI key files that
then contain all the keys that the individual components for their
products are signed with. This file name needs to be registered at the
time of shim review and should not be changed without going back to a
shim review. A vendor should be able to store as many certificated (or
a CA certificate) as they need for all the components of all of their
products. Older versions of this file can be revoked via SBAT. In
order to limit the footprint of the SBAT revocation metadata, it is
vital that vendors do not create additional key files beyond what they
have been approved for at shim review.

#### Key Revocations
Since Vendor Product keys are brought into Shim as signed binaries,
generation numbering can and should be used to revoke them in case of
a private key compromise.

#### Kernel support for SBAT

The initial SBAT implementation will add SBAT metadata to Shim and
GRUB and enforce SBAT on all components labeled with it. Until a
component (e.g. the Linux kernel gains SBAT metadata) it can not be
revoked via SBAT, but only by revoking the keys signing that
component. These keys will should live in separate, product-specific
signed PE files that contain **only** the certificate and SBAT
metadata for the key files. These key files can then be revoked via
SBAT in order to invalidate and replace a specific key. While
certificates built into Shim can be revoked via SBAT and Shim
introspection, this practice would still result in a proliferation of
Shim binaries that would need to be revoked via dbx in the event of an
early Shim code bug. Therefore, SBAT must be used in conjunction with
separate Vendor Product Key binaries.

At the time of this writing, revoking a Linux kernel with a
lockdown compromise is not spelled out as a requirement for shim
signing. In fact, with limited dbx space and the size of the attack
surface for lockdown it would be impractical do so without SBAT. With
SBAT it should be possible to raise the bar, and treat lockdown bugs
that would allow a kexec of a tampered kernel as revocations.


#### Kernels execing other kernels (aka kexec, fast reboot)

It is expected that kexec and other similar implementations of kernels
spawning other kernels will eventually consume and honor SBAT
metadata. Until they do, the same Vendor Product Key binary based
revocation will need to be used for them.


#### Generation-Based Revocation Metadata
Adding a .sbat section containing the SBAT metadata structure to PE images.

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| component_name | the name we're comparing
| component_generation | the generation number for the comparison
| vendor_name | human readable vendor name
| vendor_package_name | human readable package name
| vendor_version | human readable package version (maybe machine parseable too, not specified here)
| vendor_url | url to look stuff up, contact, whatever.

The format of this .sbat section is comma separated values, or more
specifically UTF-8 encoded strings.


Example sbat sections
---------------------
For grub, a build from a fresh checkout of upstream might have the following in
`.sbat`:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,1,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
```

A Fedora build believed to have exactly the same set of vulnerabilities plus
one that was never upstream might have:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,1,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.fedora,1,The Fedora Project,grub2,2.04-31.fc33,https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grub2
```

Likewise, Red Hat has various builds for RHEL 7 and RHEL 8, all of which have
something akin to the following in `.sbat`:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,1,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.02,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.fedora,1,Red Hat Enterprise Linux,grub2,2.02-0.34.fc24,mail:secalert@redhat.com
grub.rhel,1,Red Hat Enterprise Linux,grub2,2.02-0.34.el7_2,mail:secalert@redhat.com
```

The Debian package believed to have the same set of vulnerabilities as upstream
might have:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,1,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.debian,1,Debian,grub2,2.04-12,https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/grub2
```

Another party known for less than high quality software who carry a bunch of
out of tree grub patches on top of a very old grub version from before any of
the upstream vulns were committed to the tree.  They haven't ever had the
upstream vulns, and in fact have never shipped any vulnerabilities.  Their grub
`.sbat` might have the following (which we'd be very suspect of signing, but
hey, suppose it turns out to be correct):
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub.acme,1,Acme Corporation,grub,1.96-8191,https://acme.arpa/packages/grub
```

At the same time, we're all shipping the same `shim-16` codebase, and in our
`shim` builds, we all have the following in `.sbat`:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
shim,0,UEFI shim,shim,16,https://github.com/rhboot/shim
```

How to add .sbat sections
-------------------------
Components that do not have special code to construct the final PE
files can simply add this section using objcopy(1):

```
objcopy --set-section-alignment '.sbat=512' --add-section .sbat=sbat.csv foo.efi

```



#### UEFI SBAT Variable content

The SBAT UEFI variable contains a descriptive form of all components used by
all UEFI signed Operating Systems, along with a minimum generation number for
each one. It may also contain a product-specific generation number, which in
turn may also specify version-specific generation numbers. It is expected that
specific generation numbers will be exceptions that will be obsoleted if and
when the global number for a component is incremented.

Initially the SBAT UEFI variable will set generation numbers for
components to 1, but is expected to grow as CVEs are discovered and
fixed. The following show the evolution over a sample set of events:

Starting point
--------------
Before CVEs are encountered, an undesirable moudule was built into the a
fedora grub, so it's product-specific generation number has been bumped:

```
sbat,1
shim,1
grub,1
grub.fedora,2
```

Along comes bug 1
-----------------
Another kind security researcher shows up with a serious bug, and this one was
in upstream grub-0.94 and every version after that, and is shipped by all
vendors.

At this point, each vendor updates their grub builds, and updates the
`component_generation` in `.sbat` to `1`.  The GRUB upstream build now looks like:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.05,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
```

But Fedora's now looks like:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.fedora,2,The Fedora Project,grub2,2.04-33.fc33,https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/grub2
```

Other distros either rebase on 2.05 or theirs change similarly to Fedora's.  We now have two options for Acme Corp:
- add a `grub.acme,2` entry to `SBAT`
- have Acme Corp add `grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,1.96,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/` to their new build's `.sbat`

We talk to Acme and they agree to do the latter, thus saving flash real estate
to be developed on another day.  Their binary now looks like:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,1.96,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.acme,1,Acme Corporation,grub,1.96-8192,https://acme.arpa/packages/grub
```

The UEFI CA issues an update which looks like:
```
sbat,1
shim,1
grub,1
grub.fedora,1
```

Which is literally the byte array:
```
{
  's', 'b', 'a', 't', ',', '1', '\n',
  's', 'h', 'i', 'm', ',', '1', '\n',
  'g', 'r', 'u', 'b', ',', '2', '\n',
  'g', 'r', 'u', 'b', '.', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'o', 'r', 'a', ',', '2', '\n',
}
```

Acme Corp gets with the program
-------------------------------
Acme at this point discovers some features have been added to grub and they
want them.  They ship a new grub build that's completely rebased on top of
upstream and has no known vulnerabilities.  Its `.sbat` data looks like:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.05,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.acme,1,Acme Corporation,grub,2.05-1,https://acme.arpa/packages/grub
```

Someone was wrong on the internet and bug 2
-------------------------------------------
Debian discovers that they actually shipped bug 0 as well (woops).  They
produce a new build which fixes it and has the following in `.sbat`:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,2,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.debian,2,Debian,grub2,2.04-13,https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/grub2
```

Before the UEFI CA has released an update, though, another upstream issue is
found.  Everybody updates their builds as they did for bug 1.  Debian also
updates theirs, as they would, and their new build has:
```
sbat,1,SBAT Version,sbat,1,https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
grub,3,Free Software Foundation,grub,2.04,https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
grub.debian,2,Debian,grub2,2.04-13,https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/grub2
```

And the UEFI CA issues an update to SBAT which has:
```
sbat,1
shim,1
grub,3
grub.fedora,1
```

The grub.fedora product-specific line could be dropped since a Fedora
GRUB with a global generation number that also contained the bug that
prompted the fedora-specific revocation was never published. This
results in the following reduced UEFI SBAT revocation update:
```
sbat,1
shim,1
grub,3
```

Two key things here:
- `grub.debian` still got updated to `2` in their `.sbat` data, because a vulnerability was fixed that is only covered by that updated number.
- There is still no `SBAT` update for `grub.debian`, because there's no binary that needs it which is not covered by updating `grub` to `3`.
