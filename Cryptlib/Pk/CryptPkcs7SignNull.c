/**
  Creates a PKCS#7 signedData as described in "PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message
  Syntax Standard, version 1.5". This interface is only intended to be used for
  application to perform PKCS#7 functionality validation.

  Return FALSE to indicate this interface is not supported.

  @param[in]  PrivateKey       Pointer to the PEM-formatted private key data for
                               data signing.
  @param[in]  PrivateKeySize   Size of the PEM private key data in bytes.
  @param[in]  KeyPassword      NULL-terminated passphrase used for encrypted PEM
                               key data.
  @param[in]  InData           Pointer to the content to be signed.
  @param[in]  InDataSize       Size of InData in bytes.
  @param[in]  SignCert         Pointer to signer's DER-encoded certificate to sign with.
  @param[in]  OtherCerts       Pointer to an optional additional set of certificates to
                               include in the PKCS#7 signedData (e.g. any intermediate
                               CAs in the chain).
  @param[out] SignedData       Pointer to output PKCS#7 signedData.
  @param[out] SignedDataSize   Size of SignedData in bytes.

  @retval FALSE  This interface is not supported.
