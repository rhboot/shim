- Versioned protocol:
  - Make shim and the bootloaders using it express how enlightened they
    are to one another, so we can stop earlier without tricks
  - Make EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_2 protocol and a LOAD_IMAGE protocol with
    LoadImage/CheckImage/StartImage.
- Implement EFI_CERT_X509_SHA{256,384,512} revocation checks
  - It doesn't necessarily have to include timestamp checking support
- Make the openssl code supply the Pkcs7Verify() API, and use the system
  one (instead) if it is available.
  - And make building it optional
- Get meb30's multiple-certs patch merged
- Hashing of option roms:
  - hash option roms and add them to MokListRT
  - probably belongs in MokManager
  - And some PCR?
- Ability to specify second stage as a device path
  - including vendor path that means "parent of this image's path"
  - including vendor path that means "this image"
  - including path that's like Fv() to embed images.
- Make all build options be able to be set in 'git config --local shim.OPTION'
  - Make the build dump those to stdout as well
- make debuginfo paths configurable
- make arch dependent names configurable
- Make it easier to avoid CryptPem
- Make an easy strip+implant tool for our embedded cert lists
- Post process full path names out of __FILE__ / __BASE_FILE__ entries in
  the string table :/
- Make build.log an artifact of building.
- KEK for Mok.  (koike expressed an interest in working on this.)
